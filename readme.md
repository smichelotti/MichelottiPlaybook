## MichelottiPlaybook

Michelotti Playbook is a side project created for managing the complete "playbook" of my AAU basketball team.
It includes videos of all of our plays so the players can review on their own time. It also contains complete
off-season workouts for all players. It will also manage all planning aspects of practice.
